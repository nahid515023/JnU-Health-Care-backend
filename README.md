# JnU Counseling Center Android App

## Project Overview

The **JnU Counseling Center App** is an innovative mobile solution aimed at enhancing mental health support for students at Jagannath University. This app digitizes processes such as form submissions, appointment scheduling, and session monitoring, making counseling services more efficient and accessible for students and administrators alike.

## Problem Statement

Students currently face several challenges in accessing mental health services:

- **Manual Form Collection**: Collecting physical forms is inconvenient and time-consuming.
- **Inefficient Processes**: Manual workflows lead to delays and inefficiencies.
- **No Option for Cancellations**: Students cannot cancel counseling requests once submitted.
- **Limited Session Records**: Students lack a centralized way to track their counseling history.

## Solution - JnU Counseling Center App

Our app addresses these issues by providing:

- **Digital Form Submission**: Streamlined electronic form completion and submission.
- **Appointment Cancellations**: Simple and user-friendly cancellation options for appointments.
- **Session History Tracking**: Comprehensive session records for students to track past counseling engagements.
- **Session Monitoring for Admins**: SuperAdmins can view, monitor, and manage active and past counseling sessions, including details such as date, time, counselor, and student information.

## Tools and Technologies

### Frontend (Doctor Appointment App)
